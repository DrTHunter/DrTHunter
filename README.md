## Hi there 👋

About Me
Hi, I’m Trent Hunter — a U.S. Army Veteran (former combat medic) and former Supervisory Management Analyst at the Department of Veterans Affairs, where I oversaw Specialty Medicine at a major U.S. hospital. After burning out on 65+ hour weeks, I rebuilt my life around self-taught coding, entrepreneurship, and systems design—with a long-term focus on building things that actually last 

🔭 I’m currently working on: modular, secure web systems and AI-adjacent tooling (local-first, privacy-conscious, built to compound over time) 

🌱 I’m currently learning: deeper infrastructure + automation workflows (Docker, secure tunnels, self-hosting patterns), and pushing my understanding of AI + cognition 

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: practical, production-minded projects—especially tooling that improves focus, ops, or knowledge workflows; also anything at the intersection of AI + systems + meaning 

🤔 I’m looking for help with: connecting with builders who care about clean architecture, durability, and shipping real systems (and not getting lost in “idea vapor”) 

💬 Ask me about: system design, self-hosted tooling, web platforms, resilience/reinvention, and the philosophy side of building (identity, meaning, consciousness) 

📫 How to reach me: dr_hunter@yahoo.com

⚡ Fun fact: I’ve edited multiple book manuscripts, and I’m obsessed with building long-arc creative/technical systems that outlive the moment
