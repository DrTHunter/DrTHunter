Hi, I’m Trent Hunter — a U.S. Army Veteran and former Supervisory Management Analyst at the Department of Veterans Affairs, where I led operations for Specialty Medicine at a major hospital. After burning out on 65+ hour weeks, I rebuilt my career around full-stack development, systems design, and creating tools that actually solve real problems.
I’m a builder first. Self-taught, product-driven, and focused on shipping working systems—local-first, privacy-conscious, modular, and built to compound over time. Most of my work revolves around practical automation, AI-adjacent tooling, and productivity platforms that I design, deploy, and maintain end-to-end.
🔭 Currently building
Secure, modular web systems
Local-first AI tools (Open WebUI extensions, memory systems, productivity agents)
Developer utilities that solve real workflow pain points
🌱 Currently learning
Infrastructure & automation (Docker, tunnels, services, CI/CD)
Systems architecture & backend patterns
Deeper AI behavior + cognition modeling
👯 Open to collaborating on
Practical, production-minded tools — especially in:
AI + systems engineering
developer productivity
workflow automation
knowledge & memory systems
self-hosted platforms
🤔 Looking for
Other builders who care about:
clean architecture
maintainability
real-world constraints
solving problems instead of just talking about them
💬 Ask me about
System design, ops workflows, self-hosted tools, resilience, reinvention, and the deep philosophical side of AI + identity.

⚡ Fun fact
I’ve edited multiple book manuscripts and I love building long-arc creative and technical systems—projects designed to grow, evolve, and endure.
