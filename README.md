# 👋 Hey, I’m Trent Hunter

* U.S. Army Veteran (former combat medic) and former Supervisory Management Analyst for Specialty Medicine at the Department of Veterans Affairs [1]  
* After burning out on 65+ hour weeks, I rebuilt my life around full-stack development, systems design, and building tools that actually solve real problems [1]  

I’m a builder — self-taught, product-driven, and focused on creating systems that are:  
* modular  
* privacy-conscious  
* local-first  
* built to compound over time  

Most of my work centers on practical automation, AI-adjacent tools, and developer/productivity systems I design, deploy, and maintain end-to-end.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I’ve edited multiple book manuscripts, and I love building long-arc creative/technical systems — projects designed to evolve, endure, and outlast the moment [1].
